# task-tow-
In this task we will work on Motor drive design and implementation for two-wheel robot base
Used equipments: 
breadbord small
Arduino Uno R3
9V battery
2 DC motor
L 293d bridg 
Firstly; we connect a wire from the Arduino Uno R3 5v to a positive breabord then connect a wire from the Arduino Uno R3 GND to a negative breabord
Secondly; we put the L293D bridge in the middle of Breadbord
Thirdly; connect the six wires of the Arduino Uno R3 DIGITAL (PWM) to breadboard 
Fourthly; connect two wires from dc motor 1 negative and positive to the first half of the breadbord and two wires from dc motor 2 negative and positive to the second half of the breadbord
Fifthly; we connect the 9v battery with the breadbord

The task of designing an electrical circuit for eye control
Used equipments: 
Arduino Uno R3
2 led 
2 transistor
Firstly; we connect a wire from the cathode transistor to the Arduino Uno R3 GND
Secondly; we connected a wire from the Arduino Uno R3 DIGITAL (PWM) to terminal 1 of the transistor and a wire from terminal 2 to the Anode led
We do the same for led 2
